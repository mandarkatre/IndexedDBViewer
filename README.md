This application displays the HTML5 indexedDB database for a given domain. 
It lists the object stores and displays the data within the stores.
This application is useful for a developer when using IE10 or IE11.
It provides CRUD operations to be carried out on the IndexedDB object stores.
The files in this application need to be deployed on the server, so that developers can open the IDB.html page in the browser from their client machine and view the indexedDB created on the domain.
